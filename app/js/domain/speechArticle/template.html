      <h1>The Hierarchy of Well-Formed Speech</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      Synglossia is based on the following theoretical model of linguistics,
      called the <em>hierarchy of well-formed speech</em>, founded on my
      undergraduate thesis in mathematics.
    </p>

    <h3>Speech</h3>
    <p>
      An instance of <strong>speech</strong> is any string of zero or more
      speech sounds. Speech sounds may also include breaks in speech, which are
      called <strong>pausa</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Context Language</h3>
    <p>
      All speech is judged to be well-formed or babble relative to the rules of
      a certain given contextual language, which shall here be called the
      <strong>context language</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Phonetically Well-Formed Speech</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Phonetically well-formed speech</strong> is speech that contains
      only the speech sounds within the inventory of sounds of the
      context language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Phonetic babble</strong> is speech that is not phonetically
      well-formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babies practice phonetic babble as part of the natural language
      acquisition process. In later life, the ability to practice phonetic
      babble becomes lost as the speaker's range of sounds becomes limited to
      the sound inventories of the speaker's known language(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      Phonetically well-formed speech can be partitioned into
      <strong>phonemes</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the context language has an alphabetic writing system
      (including a deficient writing system such as an abjad), it can represent
      all phonetically well-formed speech.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Phonotactically Well-Formed Speech</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Phonotactically well-formed speech</strong> is phonetically
      well-formed speech in which the ordering of sounds follow the phonotactic
      rules of the context language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Phonotactic babble</strong> is phonetically well-formed speech
      that is not phonotactically well-formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phonotactically well-formed speech can be partitioned into
      <strong>syllables</strong>. The boundaries between syllables are always
      at the boundaries between phonemes, but the values of phonemes in a
      syllable can be affected by context outside the syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In languages the phonotactic rules of which allow different sets of
      consonant clusters at word-boundaries and at syllable-boundaries within
      words, phonotactic speech can also be partitioned into individual
      <strong>words</strong>. For this reason, it is sometimes said of certain
      languages such as Japanese that individual words do not exist, because
      the phonotactics rules of these language treat word-boundaries and
      syllable-boundaries within words identically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boundaries between words are always at the boundaries between
      phonemes, but the values of phonemes for a given word can be affected
      by contexts outside the word according to phonotactic rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the context language has a moraic or syllabic writing system,
      it can represent all phonotactically well-formed speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      For most adult speakers of the context language, phonotactically
      well-formed speech defines the boundary of speech that is pronounceable.
      The average adult is unable to produce phonotactic babble or phonetic
      babble without special training.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Morphologically Well-Formed Speech</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Morphologically well-formed speech</strong> is phonotactically
      well-formed speech in which every word is a possible output of the
      morphology of the context language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Morphological babble</strong> is phonotactically well-formed
      speech that is not morphologically well-formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morphology of a language is a collection of basic morphemes and
      irregular constructions. Regular constructions can be formed by putting
      together morphemes in the morphology of the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike words, morphemes do not always correspond to a substring of
      phonemes that concatenate when morphemes are combined. Sometimes
      morphemes are represented by transforming existing phonemes rather than
      adding new phonemes. An example in English is the ablaut of the
      vowel in the word "foot" as a marker of the plural number.
    </p>
    <p>
      In morphologically well-formed speech, every word has a part of speech
      and assigned values according to grammatical categories, but semantic
      meaning is not considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In morphologically well-formed speech, the individual words make sense,
      but the way in which the words are put together may not make sense
      grammatically or semantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the context language has a logographic writing system, it
      can represent all morphologically well-formed speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most nonsense speech coined by adults is morphological babble. Examples
      include nonsense syllables in music and character catch-phrases in
      comic books and television shows. Words of onomatopoeic etymology
      originate from morphological babble.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Syntactically Well-Formed Speech</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Syntactically well-formed speech</strong> is morphologically
      well-formed speech in which words are in proper order according to the
      rules of syntax of the context language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Syntactic babble</strong> is morphologically well-formed speech
      that is not syntactically well-formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Syntactically well-formed speech can be partitioned into
      <strong>sentences</strong>. The boundaries between sentences are always at
      the boundaries between words.
    <p>
      In syntactically well-formed speech, the individual words make sense,
      and the way they are put together grammatically makes sense, but the way
      that they are used semantically in the sentence might not make sense.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Topically Well-Formed Speech</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Topically well-formed speech</strong> is syntactically
      well-formed speech in which all words and usages of words conform to
      concepts that already exist in a given topic of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Topical babble</strong> is syntactically well-formed speech that
      is not topically well-formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is an example
      provided by Noam Chomsky of syntactically well-formed English speech that
      is not topically well-formed, because as of most usual contexts, some
      adjectives such as "colorless" and "green" have contradictory meanings.
      In order for this sentence to be topically well-formed, it must follow
      after a context that introduces the words in such a way as to validate
      their usage in this sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In topically well-formed speech, the individual words make sense, the way
      words are put together grammatically make sense, and the way words are
      used semantically in the sentence make sense.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Altogether, the various levels of well-formed speech produce the
      following hierarchy.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Topically well-formed speech.</li>
      <li>Syntactically well-formed speech.</li>
      <li>Morphologically well-formed speech.</li>
      <li>Phonotactically well-formed speech.</li>
      <li>Phonetically well-formed speech.</li>
      <li>Speech.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Altogether, this means that a language must have the following properties
      in order to be able to define the highest level of well-ordered speech.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An inventory of phonemes.</li>
      <li>A set of rules describing the proper order of phonemes in speech.</li>
      <li>An inventory of morphemes that can be used to form words, and irregular words.</li>
      <li>A set of rules describing the proper order of words in speech.</li>
      <li>An inventory of concepts, and a set of logical rules describing how these concepts must interact with each other.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The concept of a language according to this model is stricter than the
      usual concept of a language in the scientific sense. English, French,
      Chinese, and so forth are examples of languages that defined well-formed
      speech up through the syntactic level, but excluding the topical level.
      For this reason, topical babble is considered proper use of language in
      the scientific sense, despite that it has no apparent usage in a
      real-world context that would not identity it as babble. Examples of
      languages in the sense of this model may be something like
      "sales English," or "medical English."
    </p>
    <p>
      Subdividing a language in the usual scientific sense in this way is not
      unique to the topical level. In fact, distinct dialects within a language,
      such as General American English and Southern American English, differ on
      levels as low as the phonetic level.
